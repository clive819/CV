## üë®‚Äçüíª Experiences

**Internship in Artificial Intelligence** @[Industrial Technology Research Institute](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/index.aspx) <br>
_(Jun 2020 - Aug 2020)_ <br>

- Collaborated with a team of 4 in developing a fully automated surveillance system, which prevents the crucial assets from being swapped in transit, by utilizing **PyTorch** and **OpenCV**.
- Integrated the developed system into **iOS** devices.
- Designed a website to showcase our project result on **Taiwan Innovation technology Exhibition (TIE)** ‚Äî an exhibition with 500+ research units from over 40 nations.
- Responsible for configuring the **NVIDIA Jetson TX2** module, and deploy the developed system onto it.
- Improved the original database grouping algorithm‚Äôs performance by 6.27x on average (from 1.38 to 0.22 ms).
- Improved the server initialization time by 2.6x on average (from 2.00 to 0.75 seconds).
